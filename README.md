# RDF 2 DOT

A converter that generates DOT graphs from RDF files. I've written the converter to generate the figures for a breakout and my talk at the COMBINE 2015 [COMBINE (archive) meta data](http://www.slideshare.net/binfalse/combine-archive-meta-data). Might be useful for others. Here you are!

Do not hesitate to contact me in case of questions/doubts.
